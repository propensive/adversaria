# Adversaria

__Adversaria__ is a tiny library which provides a few tools to make it easier to work with static
_annotations_ in Scala, by making them available through _typeclass interfaces_.

## Features

- access all annotations on a type through a typeclass
- resolve a typeclass instance only if a type has an annotated field
- makes annotations more useful and accessible in Scala
- no macro code is required to use annotations
ƒ

## Getting Started

The nature of annotations in Scala is that they are very rarely the best solution for any task, but
can be convenient in certain circumstances, and this small domain is where Adversaria aims to help.

Currently three use cases are supported:

- getting all the annotations applied to a particular type
- finding the parameter of a case class to which a particular annotation has been applied
- getting all the annotations applied to a particular case class field

The list of supported use cases may grow.

## Examples

If we were to define the following annotations,
```scala
import scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

final case class id() extends StaticAnnotation
final case class count(n: Int) extends StaticAnnotation
```

we could apply them to some case classes, such as,
```scala
@count(10)
case class Company(name: String)

case class Person(name: String, @id email: String)
```


## Status

Adversaria is classified as __fledgling__. Propensive defines the following five stability levels for open-source projects:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

## Availability

Adversaria&rsquo;s source is available on GitHub, and may be built with [Fury](https://github.com/propensive/fury) by
cloning the layer `propensive/adversaria`.
```
fury layer clone -i propensive/adversaria
```
or imported into an existing layer with,
```
fury layer import -i propensive/adversaria
```
