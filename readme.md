# Adversaria

__Providing typeclass interfaces to user-defined Scala annotations__

__Adversaria__ is a tiny library which provides a few tools to make it easier to work with static
_annotations_ in Scala, by making them available through _typeclass interfaces_.

## Features

- access all annotations on a type through a typeclass
- resolve a typeclass instance only if a type has an annotated field
- makes annotations more useful and accessible in Scala
- no macro code is required to use annotations


## Availability

Adversaria has not yet been published as a binary.

## Getting Started

Annotations in Scala are rarely the best solution for any task, but can
nevertheless be convenient as a "feature of last resort" when no other solution
provides the right ergonomics. This small domain is where Adversaria helps.

Currently three use cases are supported:
- getting all the annotations applied to a particular type
- finding the particular parameter of a case class to which a certain
  annotation has been applied
- getting every annotation applied to a particular case class field

This list of supported use cases is likely to grow.

### Annotations

If we define the following annotations in the standard way (each starting with
a lower-case letter, as is the convention)
```scala
import scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

final case class id() extends StaticAnnotation
final case class count(n: Int) extends StaticAnnotation
```
we could apply them to some case classes, such as:
```scala
@count(10)
case class Company(name: Text)
case class Person(name: Text, @id email: Text)
```

We would like to write code that can access annotations such as `@count` and
`@id` through a simple typeclass interface.

### Contextual evidence

Elsewhere, we may have a polymorphic method, say `inspect`, which inspects an
instance of a type:
```scala
def inspect[T](value: T): Unit
```

If we would like to get the annotations on `T` that are subtypes of `count`, we
can get these with the typeclass, `Annotations`:
```scala
def inspect[T](value: T)(using anns: Annotations[count, T]): Unit =
  anns.collect:
    case `count`(n: Int) => println(t"count = $n")
```

If `inspect` is called with a type, `T`, that does not have any `@count`
annotations, then no contextual `Annotations[count, T]` instance will be
constructed, and the code will not compile. So `inspect[Company](company)`
would compile, while `inspect[Person](person)` would not.

### Direct inspection

Three methods also provide access to annotations on fields:
- `Annotations.field[T](fn)` will return a list of annotations on the case
  class field indicated by the lambda, `fn`. This lambda must be a simple field
accessor, such as `_.email`, otherwise the method will not compile.
- `Annotations.fields[T, A]` will return a list of `CaseField` instances
  providing access to the name, annotation and value (if given an instance of
`T` to dereference) for each annotation on any field with an annotation of type
`A` in `T`'s definition.
- `Annotations.firstField[T, A]` will return the first such field, if it exists.





## Status

Adversaria is classified as __fledgling__. For reference, Scala One projects are
categorized into one of the following five stability levels:

- _embryonic_: for experimental or demonstrative purposes only, without any guarantees of longevity
- _fledgling_: of proven utility, seeking contributions, but liable to significant redesigns
- _maturescent_: major design decisions broady settled, seeking probatory adoption and refinement
- _dependable_: production-ready, subject to controlled ongoing maintenance and enhancement; tagged as version `1.0.0` or later
- _adamantine_: proven, reliable and production-ready, with no further breaking changes ever anticipated

Projects at any stability level, even _embryonic_ projects, are still ready to
be used, but caution should be taken if there is a mismatch between the
project's stability level and the importance of your own project.

Adversaria is designed to be _small_. Its entire source code currently consists
of 153 lines of code.

## Building

Adversaria can be built on Linux or Mac OS with [Fury](/propensive/fury), however
the approach to building is currently in a state of flux, and is likely to
change.

## Contributing

Contributors to Adversaria are welcome and encouraged. New contributors may like to look for issues marked
<a href="https://github.com/propensive/adversaria/labels/beginner">beginner</a>.

We suggest that all contributors read the [Contributing Guide](/contributing.md) to make the process of
contributing to Adversaria easier.

Please __do not__ contact project maintainers privately with questions unless
there is a good reason to keep them private. While it can be tempting to
repsond to such questions, private answers cannot be shared with a wider
audience, and it can result in duplication of effort.

## Name

_Adversaria_ are miscellaneous collections of notes or _annotations_, after which the library is named.

In general, Scala One project names are always chosen with some rationale, however it is usually
frivolous. Each name is chosen for more for its _uniqueness_ and _intrigue_ than its concision or
catchiness, and there is no bias towards names with positive or "nice" meaningsâ€”since many of the
libraries perform some quite unpleasant tasks.

Names should be English words, though many are obscure or archaic, and it should be noted how
willingly English adopts foreign words. Names are generally of Greek or Latin origin, and have
often arrived in English via a romance language.
