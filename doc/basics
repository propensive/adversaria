The nature of annotations in Scala is that they are very rarely the best solution for any task, but
can be convenient in certain circumstances, and this small domain is where Adversaria aims to help.

Currently three use cases are supported:

- getting all the annotations applied to a particular type
- finding the parameter of a case class to which a particular annotation has been applied
- getting all the annotations applied to a particular case class field

The list of supported use cases may grow.

## Examples

If we were to define the following annotations,
```scala
import scala.annotation.StaticAnnotation

final case class id() extends StaticAnnotation
final case class count(n: Int) extends StaticAnnotation
```

we could apply them to some case classes, such as,
```scala
@count(10)
case class Company(name: String)

case class Person(name: String, @id email: String)
```
